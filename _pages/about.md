I am an Assistant Professor in the Operations Department at the Kellogg School of Management. Before joining Kellogg, I was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at William & Mary for 1.5 years. I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Research from Georgia Tech in December 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/). 

My research is at the intersection of applied probability and optimization. Specifically, I study delay in a variety of Stochastic Processing Networks (or queueing systems). I love developing novel analysis methodologies that allow better understanding of the delay or queue lengths distribution in queueing systems. In particular, I enjoy using Moment Generating Functions and most of my work is on heavy-traffic analysis.

In Kellogg, I teach the Operations Management core class for MBA students. The main focus is on learning key concepts in operations to develop an intuition of what is good operations and how to improve the operations of a company.

When I am not working, you will probably find me surrounded by dogs: my own or the dogs at the [Evanston Animal Shelter](https://evanstonanimalshelter.net/) (EAS). I enjoy dog training, and I am very passionate about volunteering at EAS (#adoptdontshop). As a volunteer, I walk dogs a couple of times a week, I am an adoption counselor, and I help with transportation and some media content. Some of these are available in my "Fun" tab.
