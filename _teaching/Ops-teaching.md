## General description of the class

This course provides a general introduction to operations management. Operations management is the design
and control of business processes, that is, the recurring activities of a firm. Along with finance and
marketing, operations is one of the three primary functions of a firm. At the risk of being simplistic, one
may say that marketing generates the demand, finance provides the capital, and operations produces the
product or delivers the service. More generally, operations spans the entire organization: COOs are in charge
of R&D, design/engineering, production operations, marketing, sales, support and service.
This course aims to (1) familiarize you with the major operational problems and issues that confront managers,
and (2) provide you with language, concepts, insights and tools to deal with these issues in order to
gain competitive advantage through operations.

This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring a career in designing and managing business
processes, either directly (V.P. of Ops, COO) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course should
also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between operations and other business functions such as
finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. Finally, a working knowledge of operations,
which typically employs the greatest number of employees and requires the largest investment in assets, is
indispensable for general managers and entrepreneurs.

We will see how different business strategies require different business processes, and vice versa, how different
operational capabilities allow and support different strategies to gain competitive advantage. A process view
of operations will be used to analyze different key operational dimensions such as capacity management, flow
time management, and supply chain management.
